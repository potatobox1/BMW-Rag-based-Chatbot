WHY MINI

BIG LOVE

Product

Challenge what’s expected.

All MINI owners share one key characteristic: an unwillingness to shrink themselves to fit the norm. We're nonconformists who challenge the status quo, paving the way towards a bigger, braver, bolder future. Our all-new lineup is a labor of love and a catalyst for it. We reinvented everything this time, including the wheel.

Technology

Tech on Another Level

View the world from a world-first 9.4" circular OLED display, complete with up to eight MINI Experience Modes with ambient lighting and matching projections to meet the moment.

MEET SPIKE

This available copilot is always ready for direction tips and tricks. Just say “Hey Spike” to welcome our first fully-fledged voice assistant into the cockpit.

MINI OS

A software powerhouse optimized for touch and voice control. MINI Operating System 9 features cloud-based navigation and effortless connectivity.

Safety

SUPERSIZED SAFETY

Put simply, we take safety seriously. That’s why MINIs come with a suite of standard safety features and available add-ons. We put peace of mind first, so you can focus on the fun.

Safety comes standard

Lane Departure Warning, Blind Spot Detection, and Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation are just a few of the standard safety features keeping you protected on every drive.

Driving Assistant Pro

Active Driving Assistant Professional, available on the MINI Countryman, provides partly-automated support to deliver confidence while cruising at speeds up to 37 mph.

People

Stand for something wonderful.

MINI is on a never-ending mission to spread joy, and our owners play a pivotal role by bringing Big Love energy everywhere they go. When they see a fellow MINI, they wave, they park next to it, they ask a question. The shared joy of driving an oversized go-kart has proven enough to turn strangers into friends, time and time again.

Racing has been in our DNA for over 60 years when the Classic MINI Cooper 997 was introduced and a rally demon was born, but the fun is still just getting started.
