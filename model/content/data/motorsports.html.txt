A DRIVING FORCE.

Alec Issigonis built a practical car, a car for everyone. So, it came as quite the surprise when John Cooper, auto racing legend, saw the MINI for something the world had yet to consider - a rally demon. After a few minor tweaks, the MINI Cooper 997 hit the tracks, and the rest was history.

JOIN THE 37 CLUB

Almost 60 years have passed, but the memory of the great triumph achieved by the small car with the starting number 37 has not faded. In 1964, the classic Mini Cooper S clinched the first of three overall victories at the legendary Monte Carlo Rally. Behind the wheel was rally driver Patrick “Paddy” Hopkirk. MINI has been claiming corners on racetracks and roads ever since.

A LEGACY LIVES ON

MINI has always felt at home on the track. John Cooper’s name has stood for excellence and performance since he first discovered the racing potential of the Classic MINI in the early 60s. The MINI John Cooper Works team, named after his legacy and spirit, is owned and operated by Indianapolis-based LAP Motorsports and has three cars participating in the TC America class of the World Challenge series.

The Dakar Rally The Dakar Rally is a race unlike any other. Its extreme nature, daring backdrops, and rigorous stages are known to bring the best of the best to their knees. But not for MINI. In 2021, MINI saw its sixth overall win in the Saudi Arabian desert when Stéphane Peterhansel triumphed in his MINI JCW Buggy.

Meet Luis Perocapri Luis Perocapri has been the heart and team owner of the JCW Race Team for over nine years — leading the crew to a number of historic victories. He founded LAP Motorsports LLC in 2008 and has been a longtime champion and supporter of MINI Motorsports.

The Bulldog Race Team The heart of Bulldog Racing, a private racing team based in Nürburg with an impressive resumé of podium wins, lies within its two MINI John Cooper Works race cars - one of which competed in the Nürburgring, a legendary 24-hour long endurance racing event in Germany.
