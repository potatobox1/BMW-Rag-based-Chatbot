Hardtop 4 Door

Exterior New Body Colors Interior Design Yours

— HIGHLIGHTS —

REINVENTING SPACE

Both comfort and creative use of space were central to the original design, and are still true today. By pushing the wheels all the way out to the corners and turning the engine sideways, this car can handle tight turns like a pro with plenty of passenger room in the cockpit.

UPHOLSTERY

With multiple unique combinations, each MINI’s interior can be tailored to fit the personality of its owner. Premium stitched options like Chesterfield leather or Carbon Black leather offer first-class style and comfort.

TWINPOWER TURBO ENGINES

The Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works Hardtop 4 Door models feature the potent TwinPower Turbo punch of these award-winning precision engines.
