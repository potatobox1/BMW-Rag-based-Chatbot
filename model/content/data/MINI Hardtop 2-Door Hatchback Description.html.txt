REFRESHED EXTERIOR FEATURES

EXCITING INTERIOR UPDATES

ICONIC GO-KART MINI DRIVE

NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD

The classic hatchback now comes with more standard premium exterior features. We reenergized this classic down to even the smallest detail. From new wheels to redesigned front and back grilles, and standard LED Headlights and Union Jack Tail lights to air curtains that give you a more aerodynamic drive – this MINI is looking fresh.

GET A GLANCE, THEN A DOUBLE TAKE

An absolute highlight to our 2023 MINI Hardtop 2 Door is our all new Multitone Roof. Now available in 3 different color gradients, Soul Blue, Alpine White and Chili Red. You won’t see this on any other car because this is exclusive painting technology only a MINI can provide.

BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE

You’ll notice the MINI Hardtop 2 Door distinguishes itself from the rest with its sleek Piano Black Exterior. We went all Piano Black everything, including the door handles, front "wings", fuel filler cap, grille blade, side scuttle, taillight rings, model badge, headlight rings, rear “wings”, and tailpipe finisher.

NEVER FELT SO GREAT

We wanted to make the MINI Hardtop2 Door a great example of how a car can keep you safe and comfortable with the best technology. We amped up the interior with ambient lighting, a visually updated dashboard design, and new designs for the steering wheel and air vents.

WE UPDATED OUR TECH...

Your iconic MINI will always have your back with the new standard Lane Departure Warning, built to ensure your safety on the road with visual warning and vibrations in the steering wheel to notify you when you are drifting from your lane. We've also included standard Active Driving Assistant with active safety features such as Pedestrian and Front Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation.

… AND YOU’RE GOING TO LOVE IT.

We turned the volume way up when it came to the Hardtop 2 Door radio. This model now features the larger 8.8" Touchscreen with an updated user interface and High Gloss Black detail. We also replaced the Analog Cluster with our brand new Dynamic Digital Instrument Cluster. Now, you can easily view information like Vehicle Speed, Driving Modes, Turn-by-Turn Navigation, Communications, Multimedia, and much more digitally.

CHECK OUT THE FULL SPECS

The MINI Hardtop 2 Door comes fully equipped with seating for 4 adults, a TwinPower Turbo engine configuration, and get from 0-60 in as little at 5.9 seconds with the JCW model.as little at 6.5 seconds with the Cooper S model.
