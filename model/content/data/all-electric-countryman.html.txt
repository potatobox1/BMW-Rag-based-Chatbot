MINI Highlights

The perfect outlet for fun.

An electric car bursting with energy

We’re go-karting towards a fully electrified future and bursting into a bold new era of maximum MINIness. Our new generation of models is defined by charismatic simplicity that’s built for tomorrow but very much ready for today.

An industry-first 9.4” round OLED display

The circle is at the heart of our design heritage, starting with a first-in-industry 9.4” round center information display in OLED technology that’s brought to life with a brand-new MINI Operating System 9.

The immersive MINI Interaction Unit

We’re taking a quantum leap into the digital age with the MINI Interaction Unit, bringing an immersive interior experience through unmistakable sound design and a fresh interpretation of the signature interior lighting.

Spike – MINI’s Intelligent Personal Assistant

A vibrant, stimulating ride is underscored by community and friendship. Spike is your wingman performing functions as MINI’s Personal Assistant, actioning travel-based requests like temperature control or directions on the cloud-based navigation system.

DIGITAL INNOVATION

Your voice is Spike’s command. MINI’s Intelligent Personal Assistant—our first full-capability voice assistant—uses two microphones to detect speaking and can be activated with a “Hey MINI” greeting or the push-to-talk button on the steering wheel.

Eight different Experience Modes breathe life into the interior, where a combination of color patterns mesh with four different driving sounds and light projections on the dashboard.

Pick Your Color

Picture yourself rolling.

Smokey Green

A grayish green with subtle shades and calm vibes.

EXTERIOR DESIGN

MINIer than ever.

It’s a true MINI from every angle. Flush door handles, milled-off edges, and a power-dome on the front hood pave the exterior proportions. Short overhangs merge with a long wheelbase to create a compact silhouette.

The 20” Windmill Spoke 2-tone wheels are accentuated by welcome and goodbye light orchestrations to make a stunning statement with the MINI logo projections on both the driver and passenger sides.

INTERIOR DESIGN

SUSTAINABLE CHIC.

Every inch of the interior is brimming with a luxurious textile aesthetic that invites feelings of warmth. Clean 2D-knit surfaces and chrome-free design elements are easy to clean.

The pure, minimalist approach to form is reflected in the new materials on the dashboard and in the door panel trim.
