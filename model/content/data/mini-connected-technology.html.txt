Features

Highlights.

With the latest Operating System 9, MINI Connected experiences a digital leap forward with realistic 3D visualizations in complicated turning situations, entertainment and gaming options, displays of the current traffic situation, information on parking and much more.

On earlier models, starting with Model Year 2019 vehicles, MINI Connected is available with emergency calling, remote door unlock, and send-to-car functionality on a stunning system that unites advanced technology in a 6.5" or 8.8" display.

MINI ASSIST eCALL

In an emergency, push the SOS button to send your location and vehicle information to our response center. In some cases, your MINI calls automatically and we can request help on your behalf.

MINI TELESERVICE

Your MINI monitors its own service needs so a MINI Service Advisor can contact you to schedule a convenient appointment, before you need it.

ADVANCED REAL-TIME TRAFFIC INFO

Stay informed of the latest traffic information, including construction and accidents that will affect your route so you can get where you need to go on time.

REMOTE SERVICES

Remotely unlock, lock, or send destinations to your MINI from anywhere. Also, with Stolen Vehicle Recovery, MINI Assist can help police find your vehicle.

THE NEW MINI APP

Our all-in-one app helps you avoid traffic, share arrival times, remotely lock and unlock your door, and more right from your phone.
