Highs Modernized design inside and out, more powerful engines, same lively handling.

Lows Manual transmission no longer available, laggy infotainment software, still quite small inside.

Verdict The redesigned Mini has a fresh look inside and out and is more refined than ever, but it retains the same charming character from past Minis.

By Drew Dorian

Overview

Mini's most recognizable products, the diminutive Cooper hatchback and convertible, receive a handsome new look for 2025 as part of a tip-to-tail makeover that sees a modernization of the car's design and features. The Cooper Electric debuted first and revealed that the Cooper will remain instantly identifiable as a Mini. The gasoline-powered variants covered here look similar and again include a racier S trim. All models come with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The base Cooper's engine makes 161 horsepower but the S trim gets bumped to 201 ponies. The Cooper remains a small car, but alterations to the cabin have imbued it with a more open, airier feel. Likewise, Mini has upgraded the materials inside to give the 2025 Cooper a more premium ambiance. The new Cooper S arrives first, followed closely by the entry-level Cooper and a four-door variant slated to arrive in the fall.

What's New for 2025?

The Mini Cooper is redesigned for 2025 and it wears a new look that marries the brand's future and past. A revised interior features a cool circular infotainment display and more premium materials, and boasts a slightly more spacious feeling. So far, only the two-door and four-door hatchback models have been revealed, but we expect to see a convertible join the lineup next.

Pricing and Which One to Buy

The price of the 2025 Mini Cooper Hardtop / Convertible starts at $29,945 and goes up to $37,295 depending on the trim and options.

For this latest generation of Mini's iconic Cooper, the company will offer it in two distinct models, the entry-level Cooper, and the racier Cooper S. Three trim levels will be offered—Signature, Signature Plus, and Iconic—with increasing levels of equipment. We'd choose the more powerful Cooper S, and opt for the Signature Plus trim because it adds desirable equipment and offers more customization possibilities in terms of color and trim. Opting for the four-door body style costs an extra $1000 over the two-door.

Engine, Transmission, and Performance

Both the Cooper and Cooper S come equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The entry-level Cooper pumps out 161 horsepower, but the more powerful turbocharged S model makes 201 horsepower—12 more than in the 2024 Cooper S. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission will be standard; sadly, we believe Mini will stop offering a six-speed stick with this new generation model. We drove the Cooper S and enjoyed the torquey engine and characterful exhaust note. Its handling is as sharp as ever, with the same lively feel in the corners, and the driving experience is quieter and more refined than in previous Minis.

0–60-MPH Times

According to Mini, the Cooper S can hit 60 mph in 6.3 seconds. Given that the last-generation Cooper S we tested—which had less horsepower—managed a 6.2-second time, we expect to beat Mini's claimed result when we get a chance to drive the new Cooper S for ourselves.

Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG

The EPA released fuel-economy numbers for the 2025 Cooper Hardtop S, which has a city rating of 28 mpg, a highway rating of 39 mpg, and a combined rating of 32 mpg. The highway and combined figures are up 1 mpg compared with the previous-gen model. We don't yet have EPA ratings for the base Cooper. For more information about the Cooper's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.

Interior, Comfort, and Cargo

Mini has taken a simplistic approach with the new Cooper's interior. It started by analyzing the original Mini from 1959 and settled on a pared-back design inspired by that car. But it's far less basic than the vintage model and features nice materials, a textile-covered dashboard, clever hidden LED lighting elements, and a more refined control panel with toggle switches. We enjoyed the interior's mix of materials on our drive and also noted that, although the new car is roughly the same size as the outgoing model, the interior feels more spacious and open.

Infotainment and Connectivity

The Cooper's party piece is a unique circular digital infotainment display that appears to float in front of the dashboard. A head-up display is also standard and pops up from the dash in front of the driver. Navigation, smartphone-mirroring functions, SiriusXM radio, and various built-in apps are all included in Mini's updated infotainment software.
