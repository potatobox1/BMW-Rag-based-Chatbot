As part of our 54 point body condition, fit and finish inspection, we rigorously check every inch of the MINI to see if it meets MINI guidelines and standards. We look closely at bumpers, hood, doors, roof, and all other exterior features as well as the glass area, interior, trunk, keys and more.

During these tests, we look closely at the driver’s seat functions, mirror functions, navigation system, windshield, pedal function, vehicle handling and much more.
