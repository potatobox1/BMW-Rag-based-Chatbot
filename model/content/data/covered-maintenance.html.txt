Complimentary Scheduled MINI Maintenance.

NOTICE TO MINI OWNERS.

MINI agreed to resolve allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that two statements in certain service and warranty booklets did not comply with provisions of federal warranty law. The notice below was sent to affected MINI owners. If you have questions, please call us at (866) 318-0490.

NOTICE

Maintenance is on us.

It comes standard with every new MINI† and is one of the most comprehensive scheduled maintenance programs in its class, covering recommended scheduled maintenance for up to 3 years or 36,000 miles (whichever comes first).

To receive these services at no cost, just schedule an appointment at your authorized MINI Dealer while your MINI is covered by this program. And since all services will be performed by a MINI trained and certified technician, using genuine MINI parts, your car will be maintained to our exacting standards. Which are, admittedly, higher than most.
