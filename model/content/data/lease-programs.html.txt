LEASING MADE TO MEET YOUR NEEDS

With MINI Financial Services, you can customize a lease based on your unique driving needs – choosing term lengths, mileage, and more with low monthly payments.

The Motoring Lease

Want to drive your MINI 5,000 miles? What about 50,000, or 100,000? The Motoring Lease might be the perfect fit. Decide upfront how many miles you'll need for the life of your lease, and we'll come up with a leasing plan that fits your unique needs.

The Traditional Lease

A set number of miles and easy options to switch your MINI at the end of the lease term. You can also explore individual ways to structure your lease so that it's the perfect fit for you.

PRE-PAY LEASE PROGRAM

PRE-PAY AND TAKE OFF.

If you'd prefer to pay your entire lease upfront, the Pre-Pay Lease Program offers leases with discounted payments and extra flexibility. Once your lease ends, you have the option to purchase your MINI.

MULTIPLE SECURITY DEPOSITS

AS LOW AS YOU CAN GO.

If you're looking to keep your lease payments as low as possible, you have the option to put down up to seven security deposits on a new lease or transfer the balance from an existing lease at lease end.

MILEAGE ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM

FOCUS ON THE FUN, NOT YOUR MILES.

With the Mileage Adjustment Program (MAP), you can purchase additional miles at a discounted rate, right up until the day before you turn in your vehicle. Need to purchase extra miles? Call 800-959-4269.
