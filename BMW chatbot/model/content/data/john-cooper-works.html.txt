Our Motorsports Heritage

RACING'S IN OUR BLOOD.

In 1959, the Classic MINI was a quirky newcomer—a small sports car contending as an underdog. But F1 builder John Cooper looked past the tiny package to its incredible balance, wide stance, and quicksilver handling. The result: MINI dominated 1960s racing, winning Monte Carlo four years in a row.
