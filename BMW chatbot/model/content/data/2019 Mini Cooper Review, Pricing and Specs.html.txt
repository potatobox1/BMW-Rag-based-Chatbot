Overview

The 2019 Mini Cooper is the quintessential Mini, with quirky styling and zippy handling. Available as a hardtop three- or five-door hatchback or a two-door convertible, every model features an upscale and comfy cabin. The Cooper received a light refresh for 2019 and now comes with Union Jack flag taillamps among other styling changes.

Engines, Ride, and Handling

Base 2019 Mini Cooper models have a 134-hp turbocharged three-cylinder; the sportier S has a 189-hp turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both have front-wheel drive and a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic. When we tested a five-door S model back in 2015, it managed a brisk 6.2-second zero-to-60-mph time; a convertible with the three-cylinder needed 7.5 seconds in the same test. The lineup is highly customizable and seriously fun to drive; all models come with Mini's trademark go-kart handling and gives the driver big thrills in corners, but the tradeoff is a harsh ride when driving over imperfect roads.

Interior and Technology

The Mini's interior is charmingly quirky, but at the cost of ergonomics. Rear-seat-passenger space is tight in three-door and convertible models and merely adequate in the five-door, but front-seat occupants will find little to complain about. The convertible model's power top will fold flat in 18 seconds to unlock the joy of unlimited headroom; too bad its trunk is tiny. Hardtop models offer far more practicality inside their hatchback bodies. All models come standard with a 6.5-inch infotainment touchscreen but adding navigation increases the screen size to 8.8 inches and adds real-time traffic updates and an on-board Wi-Fi hotspot.
