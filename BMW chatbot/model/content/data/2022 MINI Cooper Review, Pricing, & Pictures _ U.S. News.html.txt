2022 MINI Cooper Overview

Is the Mini Cooper a Good Car?

Yes, the Mini Cooper is a good subcompact car . It comes in three body types: the Hardtop 2 Door, Hardtop 4 Door, and Convertible. All three have potent engines, sporty handling, and a high-class cabin. The standard touch screen is easy to use too. However, this vehicle has some weaknesses, including subpar gas mileage estimates and a lack of cargo and passenger space.

Should I Buy the Mini Cooper?

The Mini Cooper is a good choice, especially if you’re seeking a driver’s car that can turn on a dime, but it costs a pretty penny. You could move up to a compact car like the Mazda3 , which is similarly athletic, and still save money. On the other hand, if you like this Mini but want more space, then you might consider the Mini Clubman or Mini Countryman . There’s also an electric version of the Cooper Hardtop called the Mini Electric Hardtop .

Mini Cooper Versus the Competition

Mini Cooper vs. Mini Countryman

The Mini Countryman is essentially an SUV variant of the Cooper. It has similar styling, features, and engines, though unlike the Cooper, the Countryman is available with a plug-in-hybrid powertrain. It also has more passenger and cargo room. However, the Countryman, while still agile, isn’t as fun to drive, and you’ll pay around $6,200 more than the Cooper for its base trim.

Compare the Mini Hardtop and Countryman »

Mini Cooper vs. Mini Clubman

The Mini Clubman is a subcompact car that shares many traits with the Cooper, such as equipment, powertrains, and agility. As with the Countryman, the Clubman is roomier than the Cooper, and it’s available with all-wheel drive. However, the Clubman is also pricier, this time by around $7,000.

Mini Hardtop Interior: Small Style

Mini Hardtop Interior Quality

Like other Mini models, this car has a stylish, distinctive cabin. The Mini Hardtop has high-quality materials and top-notch fit and finish.

Mini Hardtop Infotainment, Bluetooth, and Navigation

Mini borrows much of its infotainment system from BMW. There’s a central knob that controls some settings, as well as a large and user-friendly touch screen. Note that Apple CarPlay is supported, but Android Auto is not.

Standard infotainment features: an 8.8-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, a USB port, HD Radio, satellite radio, and a six-speaker sound system

Available infotainment features: a 12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo, Apple CarPlay, navigation, and wireless device charging

Additional standard features: a digital gauge cluster and a power-folding soft top (convertible)

Other available features: proximity keyless entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a panoramic moonroof

Mini Hardtop Cargo Space

Cargo space in this Mini varies with body style. The Mini Convertible is the smallest, with a 5.7-cubic-foot trunk that expands to 7.6 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down.

The Mini Hardtop fares better, but its trunk is still undersized for a subcompact car . There’s 8.7 cubic feet of space in the Hardtop 2 Door and 13.1 cubes in the Hardtop 4 Door. Folding down the rear seats expands those to 34 and 40.7 cubic feet, respectively.

How Many People Does the Mini Hardtop Seat?

The Hardtop 2 Door and Convertible each seat four people, and the Hardtop 4 Door seats five. However, fitting two or three people comfortably in the rear seats is no small feat. The four-door model is the best for that, and even then, the rear feels confining on anything more than a short trip. However, the front seats are well-bolstered.

Mini Hardtop and Child Car Seats

There are two complete sets of LATCH connectors for the Mini’s rear outboard seats. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety evaluated the Hardtop 2 Door’s LATCH system, giving it the second-lowest rating of Marginal for its ease of use. The lower anchors are set deeply in the seats and can be hard to maneuver around.

Mini Hardtop Performance: Pound-for-Pound Contender

Mini Hardtop Engine

Base engine: turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder with 134 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque (Cooper; starts at $22,900)

Available engines:

turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 189 horsepower and 206 pound-feet of torque (Mini Cooper S; starts at $26,900)

turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 228 horsepower and 235 pound-feet of torque (John Cooper Works; starts at $32,900)

Drivetrain: front-wheel drive

Transmission: standard six-speed manual; available seven-speed automatic (Cooper and Cooper S); available eight-speed automatic (JCW)

None of the engines in this vehicle are bad. The four-cylinders are more energetic and aid with faster acceleration, but even the base three-cylinder is well-suited for everyday driving and feels peppy when taking off from a stop.

Mini Hardtop Gas Mileage

Regardless of body type, the base Mini Cooper earns an EPA-estimated 27 mpg in the city and 37 mpg on the highway with the manual transmission and 29 mpg in the city and 38 mpg on the highway with the automatic. Those are underwhelming for the subcompact car class . The Mini Cooper S has similar fuel economy estimates, but the John Cooper Works trails with estimates that dip to 22/31 mpg. Additionally, this vehicle uses premium gasoline, so you’ll pay more at the pump compared to most rivals.

Mini Hardtop Ride and Handling

Mini models have a reputation for spirited, go-kart-like handling, and the Cooper largely lives up to that. It’s a capable corner-carver, with firm brakes and spry sportiness. The ride can be stiff, though it’s seldom harsh.

Does the Mini Cooper Have All-Wheel Drive?

No. For a Mini model with all-wheel drive, try the Clubman or Countryman .

Which Mini Cooper Model Is Right for Me?

Mini cars are known for their flexibility and customization, and the Mini Cooper is no different. For starters, Mini offers this vehicle in three body styles: a two-door hardtop, a four-door hardtop, and a convertible. There are also three variants: the Mini Cooper, Cooper S, and John Cooper Works. Each has a different powertrain. The base model has a 134-horsepower turbocharged engine, while the other two offer more powerful turbocharged four-cylinders.

Notably, the Hardtop 4 Door only comes in Cooper and Cooper S models.

On top of all that, Mini provides three trim levels: Classic, Iconic, and Signature. You can mix and match from there. For instance, you could skip the base model and get a Mini Cooper S Signature, or a John Cooper Works Classic. With so much customization, choosing the right Mini for you is a matter of preference.

There’s also an electric model called the Mini Cooper SE , which we review separately.

Mini Cooper Classic

The entry-level, two-door Mini Hardtop Classic has a starting MSRP of $22,900. Standard features include a digital gauge cluster, an 8.8-inch touch screen, a six-speaker stereo, satellite radio, HD Radio, a USB port, Bluetooth, synthetic leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, forward automatic emergency braking, and alloy wheels.

The Mini Cooper S starts at $26,900, and the John Cooper Works has a retail price of $32,900. In every setup, the four-door model costs $1,000 more than the two-door. The convertible Cooper and Mini Cooper S cost $5,000 more than the two-door, and the JCW model costs $6,000 more, starting at $38,900.

There are no major packages with this trim, but heated front seats are available for $500.

Mini Cooper Signature

Retailing for $26,900, the Cooper Hardtop 2 Door Signature adds a moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, proximity keyless entry, heated front seats, and larger alloy wheels.

The Mini Cooper S Signature retails for $30,900 for the two-door, $31,900 for the four-door, and $35,900 for the convertible. The JCW Mini Cooper S starts at $35,900 for the two-door and $40,650 for the convertible.

The Premium package costs $1,500 and adds a heated steering wheel and a credit for a Harman Kardon stereo (due to limited availability). The $2,000 Signature Upholstery package includes genuine leather seats. The $1,000 Touchscreen Navigation package comes with a navigation system and Apple CarPlay, and the $1,800 Touchscreen Navigation Plus has that plus wireless device charging. A park assist system can be added for $500.

The Signature is the first trim where you can get a seven-speed automatic transmission instead of the manual.

Mini Cooper Iconic

The Iconic starts at $30,900. It gains leather seats, a heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay, wireless device charging, a navigation system, a Harman Kardon stereo, and a head-up display. The Signature Upholstery package remains available.

The Final Call

The Mini Cooper is one of the more versatile, fun-to-drive choices in the subcompact car class . It has lively engines, and even the standard three-cylinder is a good choice for daily commutes. Inside, this Mini has a large, easy-to-use touch screen and a handsome, well-built cabin. However, it’s not the best choice for carrying passengers and their stuff, and it costs more than most of its classmates.

Don't just take our word for it. Check out comments from some of the reviews that drive our rankings and analysis.

"It puts a smile on your face not just with the way it drives, but also with the way it looks. What’s more, it’s available in multiple ways, in everything from an economical 2-door Hardtop and Convertible to a potent JCW model or an electric SE." -- Kelley Blue Book

"The Mini Cooper has an iconic style all its own, and a long list of customizable appearance options that will please individualists. But a Mini can get pricey for such a small car if you pile on the extras, no matter whether you're talking about the standard three-door hatchback, the five-door hatch models, or the costlier convertible." -- Car and Driver (2021)

"But, don't lose sight of the fact that Mini models are pricey, particularly for their segment. Yes, they are also upscale for their segment, but add a couple of options and the price really escalates. But, hey, remember the fun-to-drive part." -- Autotrader (2020)
