SUPERSIZED SAFETY.

Safety features

Available Active Blind Spot Detection

Visual cues in exterior mirrors alert the driver to hazards in blind spots, with steering wheel vibration and collision avoidance systems activating when changing lanes.

Available Lane Departure Warning

A multi-camera array helps keep the vehicle centered in its lane and alerts the driver to any unintentional drift.

Available Front Collision Warning with Brake Intervention

This system alerts the driver to potential collision threats, and automatically activates the brakes if immediate intervention is needed.

Available Rear Cross Traffic Warning and Rear Collision Prevention

Rear Collision Prevention provides visual and audible alerts to help the driver avoid potential collisions when reversing.

Available Active Cruise Control with Stop and Go Function

Innovative camera and radar-based assistance systems provide a more relaxed driving experience for long journeys by maintaining a set distance from the vehicle in front. In stop-and-go traffic, the system supports the driver by automatically slowing the vehicle to a stop and accelerating when the traffic situation permits.
