RECEIVE A BROCHURE

It’s no substitute for a thrilling test-drive, but a MINI brochure will put some nice photos and spec information in your hands. We're pleased to offer you two options:

BUILD YOUR OWN

After picking a model and customizing it in the “Build Your Own” section, you can download a personalized brochure complete with your chosen options, accessories and specs to commemorate the occasion. Just click the “REVIEW & SAVE” button after you’re done designing your MINI, select "DOWNLOAD & PRINT" and choose the first option.
