REIMBURSEMENT FOR PRIOR CUSTOMER PAY REPAIRS RELATED TO A SAFETY RECALL (TREAD ACT)

If you have paid for the repair related to a safety recall that your vehicle is affected by and you would like your expenses to be considered for reimbursement, please contact your authorized MINI dealer. Expenses paid to repair facilities outside of the MINI dealer network will be considered; however, the repair procedure must meet MINI standards.
