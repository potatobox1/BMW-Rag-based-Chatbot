BRITISH CRAFTSMANSHIP, NOW MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN EVER.

The MINI Mobility Program makes getting behind the wheel of a MINI even more enticing! Upon the purchase or lease of a new or Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) MINI from an authorized MINI Dealer, customers who require adaptive equipment to their vehicle may qualify for a one-time reimbursement of up to $2,500 of the expenses. The modifications must be completed within the New Vehicle Limited Warranty (the earlier of 4 years/50,000 miles) or the CPO Warranty (the earlier of 6 years/100,000 miles).

Customers must provide the following

Copy of the lease or purchase contract from an authorized US MINI center.

Copy of the customer's driver's license, a doctor's note or permit (vehicle must be registered and operated by the impaired driving customer).

Copy of the invoice detailing the modifications performed. Note: In instances where an air bag or air bags are deactivated, the NHTSA approval letter must also be provided.

To submit a claim, documents can be emailed to MINImobility@miniusa.com or faxed to 201-930-8484. The claim will be processed within four weeks, and a check will be issued directly to the customer.
