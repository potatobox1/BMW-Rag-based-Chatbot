GUARANTEED AUTO PROTECTION

If your MINI is ever declared a total loss due to accident, theft, or natural disaster, the last thing you want to worry about is paying off a lender. MINI Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) can help waive some or all of the difference between what you owe and the market value of your vehicle, helping to provide a little extra security.
