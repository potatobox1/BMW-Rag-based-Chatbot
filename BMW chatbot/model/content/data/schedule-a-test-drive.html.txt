Before you get rolling, take a look at MINI’s classic lineup and diverse series of models.

The test drive that hits different.

Feeling is believing.

The hype is real. MINI really is the funnest car on the road. Get behind the wheel of your favorite model today and experience the iconic go-kart handling that MINI is known for. When we say “For The Drive”—we really mean it.

Immerse in the MINIverse.

The MINI tribe dares to be different. You’ll see why when you drop by one of our dealerships for a test drive, and it’ll be easy to tell why we’re the only car that comes standard with friends™.

Surprise and delight.

With MINI, fun is always around the corner. By test driving a MINI, you’ll learn a thing or two (or ten) about what makes our models so unique. Whether it’s the size, the speed, or the style—you’ll definitely be blown away in one way or another. &nbsp;

A ride to remember.

Giddy up. You can’t replace the passion and enthusiasm that MINI dealers have for all MINI models. By visiting a dealer in-person, we promise a test drive that will leave you feeling more confident and enthusiastic about owning a MINI than ever before.

WHAT TO EXPECT

Get ready to meet MINI.

When it comes to preparing for your test drive, our team fully encourages you to sweat the small stuff. Our goal is to set you up for a safe and timely ride—so every little detail matters. Here are some of the ins and outs of what to expect about your MINI test drive.

Timing Details

Either make it a quick, speedy, and punctual ride or consider talking to your dealer about extending the adventure.

What To Bring

Keep it simple. Just bring your driver’s license along with proof of car insurance—and don’t forget the friendly wave too.

Process

Be prepared for the thrills and excitement of a life-sized go-kart. But more importantly, don’t feel like you have to rush your decision!

Miscellaneous
